# ESP-NOW (espnow.h)

- Likes working with esp8266 xp compatible
- esp8266 works with an internal lib named espnow.h
- it directly connects to its peer by its mac address
- You could broadcast 1 to many but there is latency on the receiver
- Tested decoding a GPS and broadcast to many receivers with led matrix output
